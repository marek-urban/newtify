        'From ‘Donkey Kong’ to the NES — how a Japanese company took over the American living room. An exclusive first serial from ‘Console Wars.’',
        'On September 23, 1889, just weeks before his thirtieth birthday, an entrepreneur named Fusajiro Yamauchi opened a small, rickety-looking shop in the heart of Kyoto. To attract the attention of passing rickshaws and wealthy denizens, he inscribed the name of his new enterprise on the storefront window: Nintendo, which had been selected by combining the kanji characters nin, ten, and do. Taken together, they meant roughly “leave luck to heaven” — though, like most successful entrepreneurs, Yamauchi found success by making his own luck. In an era where most businessmen were content to survive off the modest returns of regional mainstays such as sake, silk, and tea, he decided it was time to try something new. So instead of selling a conventional product, Fusajiro Yamauchi opted for a controversial one, a product that the Japanese government had legalized only five years earlier: playing cards.

In the heart of Kyoto, he and a small team of employees crafted paper from the bark of mulberry trees, mixed with soft clay, and then added the hanafuda card designs with inks made from berries and flower petals. Nintendo’s cards, particularly a series called Daitoryo (which featured an outline of Napoleon Bonaparte on the package), became the most successful in all of Kyoto.

After several decades of staggering success, Fusajiro Yamauchi retired in 1929 and was succeeded by his son-in-law Sekiryo Yamauchi, who ran Nintendo efficiently for nineteen years, but in 1948 he had a stroke and was forced to retire. With no male children, he offered Nintendo’s presidency to his grandson, Hiroshi, who was twenty-one and studying law at Waseda University. It didn’t take long for Hiroshi Yamauchi to make his presence known. He fired every manager that had been appointed by his grandfather and replaced them with young go-getters who he believed could usher Nintendo beyond its conservative past.

With innovation on his mind,Yamauchi branched out into a number of other, less lucrative endeavors, including an instant-rice company and a pay-by-the-hour “love hotel.” These disappointments led Yamauchi to the conclusion that Nintendo’s greatest asset was the meticulous distribution system that it had built over decades of selling playing cards. With such an intricate and expansive pipeline already in place, he narrowed his entrepreneurial scope to products that could be sold in toy and department stores and settled upon a new category called “videogames.”

Yamauchi wanted Nintendo to aggressively get into the videogame business, which was really two separate businesses: home consoles and coin-operated arcade games. He saw the potential in these industries and took the necessary steps for Nintendo to enter both. Despite middling results from titles like Wild Gunman and Battle Shark, Yamauchi remained committed to his new vision and continued to allocate a vast amount of resources toward videogames. In 1977 Nintendo released a shoebox-sized orange console called the Color TV-Game 6, which played six slightly different versions of electronic tennis and was met with a mixed reception. Though the console managed to sell one million units, it ultimately lost money. Nevertheless, Yamauchi remained undeterred. Nintendo continued to put out arcade games (striking out with duds like Monkey Magic and Block Fever) and also continued to release home consoles (like the Color TV-Game 15, which offered fifteen slightly different versions of electronic tennis).

By this point, Nintendo already had penetrated most of Japan, and so Yamauchi set his sights on the place where the videogame frenzy had started: America.',

        'For decades, the CIA read the encrypted communications of allies and adversaries.',
        'For more than half a century, governments all over the world trusted a single company to keep the communications of their spies, soldiers and diplomats secret.

The company, Crypto AG, got its first break with a contract to build code-making machines for U.S. troops during World War II. Flush with cash, it became a dominant maker of encryption devices for decades, navigating waves of technology from mechanical gears to electronic circuits and, finally, silicon chips and software.' ||
        'The Swiss firm made millions of dollars selling equipment to more than 120 countries well into the 21st century. Its clients included Iran, military juntas in Latin America, nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, and even the Vatican.

But what none of its customers ever knew was that Crypto AG was secretly owned by the CIA in a highly classified partnership with West German intelligence. These spy agencies rigged the company’s devices so they could easily break the codes that countries used to send encrypted messages.

The decades-long arrangement, among the most closely guarded secrets of the Cold War, is laid bare in a classified, comprehensive CIA history of the operation obtained by The Washington Post and ZDF, a German public broadcaster, in a joint reporting project.

The account identifies the CIA officers who ran the program and the company executives entrusted to execute it. It traces the origin of the venture as well as the internal conflicts that nearly derailed it. It describes how the United States and its allies exploited other nations’ gullibility for years, taking their money and stealing their secrets.

The operation, known first by the code name “Thesaurus” and later “Rubicon,” ranks among the most audacious in CIA history.

“It was the intelligence coup of the century,” the CIA report concludes. “Foreign governments were paying good money to the U.S. and West Germany for the privilege of having their most secret communications read by at least two (and possibly as many as five or six) foreign countries.”

From 1970 on, the CIA and its code-breaking sibling, the National Security Agency, controlled nearly every aspect of Crypto’s operations — presiding with their German partners over hiring decisions, designing its technology, sabotaging its algorithms and directing its sales targets.',

        'In the Washington Highlands neighborhood of Southeast DC, up
against the Maryland line, everyone plays his numbers at the market at
Sixth and Chesapeake. The old drunks troll for change, and kids who never
learned better call the Korean owner Jackie Chan. Out on the corner, the
hustle and grind never stop, and every so often, because of a fake-diamond
bracelet or for no reason at all, a spate of violence rips through the
neighborhood like a tornado through a cornfield.

Sixth and Chesapeake is where Nathaniel Dwight Simms used to
hustle—cocaine, marijuana, a little ecstasy—before March 2010, when he got
tangled up in a bad thing, picked up an AK-47, climbed into the back of a
minivan, and, along with some friends, gunned down a group of innocent
kids on South Capitol Street.

Then Nate Simms did something really crazy: He
snitched.

The South Capitol trial opened in February of last year. Five
codefendants—Sanquan “Bootsie” Carter, his brother Orlando Carter, Jeffrey
Best, Robert Bost, and Lamar Williams—stood accused of perpetrating one of
the ugliest killing sprees in Washington history, a week in which five
young people were shot to death and eight wounded.',

        'No, dummies! Here''s everything we know about season 4 part 2, set to drop in July.',
        'Take a deep breath: That Stranger Things episode 7 ending wasn’t, y’know, The End. We promise. Snatching a page from the Ozark playbook, Netflix’s deliriously anticipated thriller Stranger Things is stretching its fourth season into two parts—sorry, volumes—which means fans will have to wait a teensy bit longer for the final, actual, we-mean-it-this-time ending.

Perhaps even more confusingly, the seasonal split is lopsided. Volume 1, out as of May 27, features seven episodes, but volume 2 will feature only two. But each of those two episodes will be, as one Jason Bateman once put it, “super sized”—more like feature films than traditional television. (We can all stick around after the credits roll and argue if “television that’s more like film” is really a good idea.) As Netflix attempts to squeeze some juice out of its cash cow, here’s what we know about the next chapter.' ||
        'When does season 4 volume 2 come out?
Okay, so don’t shoot the messenger, but it’s gonna be a painful wait. The final two episodes are expected to drop at 12 a.m. PST on July 1, just in time for a Fourth of July weekend binge. Bad news: Those five weeks between May 27 and July 1 are going to pass slowly. Good news: More time for theorizing!

How long will volume 2 be? How many episodes?
Prepare for an, er, extended binge. Volume 2 might consist of only two episodes, but they''re each feature-length: Episode 8 clocks in at 1 hour and 25 minutes, while the grand finale runs 2 hours and 30 minutes. So, not as long as The Batman, but still really long!

Wait, so how does this work again?
Let''s break it down simply. The following episodes premiered at the same time on May 27:

Episode 1: “Chapter One: The Hellfire Club” (runs 1 hour and 16 minutes)
Episode 2: “Chapter Two: Vecna''s Curse” (runs 1 hour and 15 minutes)
Episode 3: “Chapter Three: The Monster and the Superhero” (runs 1 hour and 3 minutes)
Episode 4: “Chapter Four: Dear Billy” (runs 1 hour and 17 minutes)
Episode 5: “Chapter Five: The Nina Project” (runs 1 hour and 14 minutes)
Episode 6: “Chapter Six: The Dive” (runs 1 hour and 13 minutes)
Episode 7: “Chapter Seven: The Massacre at Hawkins Lab” (runs 1 hour and 39 minutes)
And then the remaining episodes premiere at the same time on July 1:

Episode 8: “Chapter Eight: Papa” (runs 1 hour and 25 minutes)
Episode 9: “Chapter Nine: The Piggyback” (runs 2 hours and 30 minutes)
Why do this to us??
Apparently, the Duffer brothers—the masterminds behind Stranger Things—felt it was warranted. “Episode 7 is as big as any season finale we’ve ever had, so it made sense to everyone involved to split the season there,” they told Variety in a joint email interview. “Episode 7 really serves as the end of the second act—and we feel that our final act had enough meat on the bone to make up Volume 2.”' ||
        'As for why a split was warranted in the first place: “As we began turning over episodes, everyone began to feel the season was too big to be released in one batch—at nearly 13 hours, it is really more two seasons than one. We discussed various release options with Ted [Sarandos, Netflix’s CEO], and early on he proposed the two volume split, which would allow us to break up the season while also staying true to Netflix’s binge model.”

In other words, blame Ted Sarandos!',
